# Mango Leaf Classifier

This project is a machine learning application designed to classify the health status of mango leaves. It utilizes image recognition techniques to identify whether a mango leaf is healthy or affected by a disease.

## Features

-   **Image Classification:** Classifies mango leaves into different health categories.
-   **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides an easy-to-use interface for uploading and classifying images.
-   **Model Training:** Includes the ability to train the model on new datasets.
-   **Model Evaluation:** Provides metrics to evaluate the performance of the trained model.

## Technologies Used

-   **Python:** The primary programming language.
-   **Pytorch:** For building and training the deep learning model.
-   **PIL:** For image processing.
-   **Gradio:** For creating the web application interface.



    ```

## Usage

1.  **Upload an image:** Use the web interface to upload an image of a mango leaf.
2.  **Classify the image:** The application will process the image and provide a classification result.
3. **Train the model:** You can train the model with new data.
